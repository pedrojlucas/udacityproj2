# Udacity Nanodegree Machine Learning Engineer with Azure project 2 (MLOps)

This project is part of the assigments of the Udacity Nanodegree Machine Learning Engineer with Azure. In this case the project is focused in developing all the MLOps phylosohpy using a example case.

In first place we will train a model with a bank marketing dataset, that is intended to find out if a customer will subscribe certain financial product or not. The training of the classification model will be carried out using Azure AutoML. The best model from the AutoML training will be deployed as and endpoint, we will test it with a python script that has attached some dummy data as a json payload.

Finally we will develop a pipeline that will automatize all the previous steps that we have carried out manually: launch of AutoML training and select the best model for deployment as an endpoint.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps.
